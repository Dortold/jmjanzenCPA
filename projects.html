				<h2>my projects</h2>
				<p>
					<ul>
					
						<li><strong>Monochrome Mapping Project</strong> (2012 - 2013, Doom (video-game))</li>
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/62724-release-monochrome-mapping-project-latest-fix-august-1st-2013/" >
									Project 'homepage' (Doomworld forum)</a></li>
								<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfngupul1soy24m/DWMMP.txt">
									Project Readme document (Dropbox)</a></li>
								<li>A disaster of a Doom community project that I led. My team and I competed directly with a sister project, which
									was started at about the same time.  We beat them to release by two years (their project is still ongoing), but the
									quality and adherence to standards of our project suffered.  I learned several valuable lessons while undertaking
									this project.</li>
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li><strong>The Dreaded Word</strong> (2013, Doom)
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/64518-wip-the-dreaded-word-1-of-3-levels-describing-a-journey-from-ruins-to-techbase/">
									Project 'homepage' (Doomworld forum)</a></li>
								<li>Another Doom project - a single map that I worked on, implementing feedback from community playtesters.
									This one went a lot more smoothly.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>College Programmes & applications</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>too many to mention, and unmentioned because while some of them may have been rather elegant, not a one 
									was especially thrilling or even satisfying to use. They were written with an eye, firstly to learning, and secondarily
									to satisfy grading criteria.  That said, I enjoyed almost every moment of designing, writing, and testing these projects.</li>
								</li>
