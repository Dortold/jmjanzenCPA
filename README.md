I decided to check out github's gh-pages functionality.  I thought it would be a great way to learn more about github, 
and establish a basic website for myself.

Unfortunately, gh-pages doesn't directly support php or mysql functionality, so I couldn't get as fancy as I wanted,
but it's still been educational.
